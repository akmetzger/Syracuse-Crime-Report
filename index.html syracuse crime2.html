  <title>A One-Of-A-Kind Look Behind Syracuse's Crime Data</title>


</head>

<body>
  
<p>With a laptop, recording device, and a hopeful attitude I walked into the Syracuse Family Court office, hoping to find answers. The head security manager prompted his colleague to find me an officer who “has some free time”. Sure enough, after a brief wait, a short officer in his mid-twenties approached me with a welcoming smile and an approachable introduction. Following my explanation of the interview guidelines though, his confident disposition faded slightly admitting that he “might not know all the answers”. He looked to his boss for assurance, and once she nodded her approval, he consented, revealing his authoritative stance.</p>

<p>It’s not a secret that the city of Syracuse is a prime spot for crime. Syracuse Police Department’s 2023 and 2024 Crime Data Summaries explicitly feature the number of criminal homicide, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft incidents present that year. These lists of numbers effortlessly reveal the truth behind the city’s imperfections. Officer Andrew Spindler might have initially doubted his ability to provide me with the information necessary, but he proved us both wrong. His extensive knowledge after only eighteen months on the job reflects the city’s alarming crime rate.</p>


<p>Andrew Spindler, a court officer at Syracuse Family Court, confirmed that most of the data was true. Although almost all the data stayed consistent from 2023 to 2024, the most common type of crime changed, sparking curiosity. In 2023, the SPD logged the most amount of motor vehicle thefts. But in 2024, the most common report was from bicycle vehicle theft. Officer Spindler confirmed this data seems logical, explaining that both car and bicycle thefts are some of the easiest crimes to catch. He explained the prosecution process is also straightforward considering it’s usually easy to prove.</p>


<p>Contrarily, the least popular type of crime reported in both 2023 and 2024 was robbery, specifically pickpocketing, purse snatching, and shoplifting. Unexpectedly, Spindler created contrast with this finding, explaining the court deals with these low-level crimes all the time. The catch is, most of the incidents were juvenile cases. “So teenagers I'd say maybe more likely to do those things because they know that it might just be a slap on the wrist for them, as opposed to an adult where they're going to actually get jail time,” Spindler said. Considering FBI Part 1 data excludes juvenile cases, Spindler's insights filled a critical gap in the statistics, revealing that this supposed outlier may not be so low, after all.</p>


<p>Both data sets include a separate column titled “Arrest”, stating whether each reported crime resulted in an arrest. This aspect reminds viewers that not every 911 call ends in a detainment. An instance of consistency between the two data sets was noted here: shoplifting larceny topped the arrest statistics in both years. Local news outlets are continuously reporting and publishing stories on shoplifting incidents in the Syracuse area. Media outlets deliver the news that is most commonly interacted with, which shows the significant concern Syracuse citizens have regarding this type of crime. Officer Spindler was prompted with the question, “Do you think you, or another officer, are more likely to arrest someone for a crime that you know the community around you is most fearful of?” His response clarified his professionalism, claiming that nothing in law enforcement is personal. Stemming from a court angle, he simplified the process illustrating that every case relies on whether or not you can prove it. Most of the evidence he works with is caught on footage, which he pointed out is a tremendous help considering cameras everywhere, and through witnesses. If you cannot get evidence of the crime, the arrest might not mean anything, he said.</p>

<p>An extreme value that stood out in the data centers around location. In both 2023 and 2024, the address with the highest number of reported crimes was 1 Destiny USA Drive, home to the ninth-largest mall in the country. In 2023, there were 420 reported crimes and in 2024, the number increased to 534. There was no other location that topped 160 reports either year, making the Destiny USA Mall a significant outlier. The youthful officer explained why this might be the case. “You’re getting all different walks of life in one spot, and there’s people trying to take advantage of that, and there’s people out there who aren’t aware. So, like, on one side you have someone who is not aware of their surroundings and then someone who's preying on that,” Spindler declared. Because this mall is a popular site for not just Syracuse locals, but visitors as well, criminals take advantage of the busy atmosphere and people’s unfamiliarity. He confirmed that the Family Court deals with shoplifting cases from the mall very often. Including us in an even bigger picture of the system, Spindler described how the Criminal Court Building only deals with more severe shoplifting cases, not the people who might steal a pack of gum. Nonetheless, they are constantly dealing with larceny cases that cover a wide spectrum. “People get away with shoplifting a lot. And they know that, so they're going to do it,” Spindler declared.</p>

<p>While Officer Spindler’s initial hesitancy caused skepticism at first, his experience proved invaluable in contextualizing Syracuse's crime statistics.  His firsthand observations transformed abstract data points into a compelling narrative, providing insights that numbers alone could never convey. Thanks to his candid perspectives, Syracuse’s crime challenges were easily highlighted. That being said, Syracuse locals can rest easier knowing that officers like Spindler are protecting their city.</p>
